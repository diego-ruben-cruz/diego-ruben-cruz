- ðŸŒ´ Skilled in Java, Javascript
- ðŸŒ± Learning HTML, CSS, C#, C, C++

I am a prospective Software Engineer that is looking to fill a specific, but necessary, niche in the software industry.

I intend to specialize in both Guided User Interface (GUI) and Guided User Experience (GUX) development. To this end, I have studied Java, Javascript, and am currently learning C, C++ and C# to be able to build GUI applications at the OS level. I have an interest in GUI and GUX, no matter the background, so I have plans to learn HTML and CSS to learn how to develop GUI applications at the web level.

Outside of software, one of my passions is making 90s Hard Dance music, and I have developed skills in recording, mixing, and mastering audio because of this. In the way of making music as a hobby, I have also picked up some experience in editing videos and creating thumbnails, visualizers, and other media associated with promoting music.

The first thing that most would say about me is that I am a deliberate/organized person, I tend to take point with the groundwork and documentation of the projects that I participate in. I also have a good sense of intuition when it comes to measuring the capabilities of my colleagues, so I can figure out what work can be done by which person, and when I can expect the task to be done.

With that being said, what can I do for your team?
You can reach out to me using diego.rubencruz@gmail.com or diego.cruz@sjsu.edu

Thank you for your time and consideration.
